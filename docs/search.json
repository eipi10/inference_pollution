In this document, we carry out part of this analysis. We retrieved most of the estimates and confidence intervals of the literature in another document. To do so, using REGular EXPressions (regex), we took advantage of a somehow standardized reporting mechanism of point estimates and confidence intervals in the abstracts. The set of articles studied in details here is therefore limited to articles displaying confidence intervals and point estimates in their abstracts. This convention is not shared by all disciplines. For instance, it is not common practice in economics but much more common in the epidemiology literature. This analysis thus focuses on a selected sample of the literature.\nIn the present document, we first explore the characteristics of the articles considered. Since we only retrieve effects for a subset of papers, we assess whether these papers are representative of the whole literature. We find that they mostly are. We then briefly explore the effects retrieved before carrying out the actual power analysis, implementing sensitivity tests to compute power, type M and type S error. Our findings suggest important heterogeneity in this literature. Some papers do not seem to present major problems while others seem to suffer from severe power issues. We therefore explore potential sources for this heterogeneity.\nKey findings and graphs are presented in the conclusion section of the present document. This section has been built to be read and understood independently. Readers who are only interested in the key findings are invited to jump straight to this section.\n\n\nArticles characteristics\nBefore diving into the power analysis itself, we look at the characteristics of the articles considered.\nWe retrieved the articles from PubMed and Scopus using the following query on May 18, 2021:\n‘TITLE((“air pollution” OR “air quality” OR “particulate matter” OR ozone OR “nitrogen dioxide” OR “sulfur dioxide” OR “PM10” OR “PM2.5” OR “carbon dioxide” OR “carbon monoxide”) AND (“emergency” OR “mortality” OR “stroke” OR “cerebrovascular” OR “cardiovascular” OR “death” OR “hospitalization”) AND NOT (“long term” OR “long-term”)) AND “short term”’\n\n\n\nThis query enables us to retrieve 1834 valid abstracts.\nThemes\nWe can briefly explore the main (unsurprising) themes of the articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetection of effects\n\n\n\n\nOut of the 1834 valid articles returned by the query, only a fraction reports estimates and confidence intervals in their abstracts. We therefore do not retrieve effects for all the articles returned by the query, mostly for the reason aforementioned. This might create some selection, making the sample of articles studied not representative of the whole literature. We investigate further the difference between articles that do and do not report confidence intervals in their abstracts in the following section.\nHere is a list of the valid articles. The last column shows whether at least one effect was retrieved for this

2666 valid effects and associated confidence intervals. We retrieve estimates for most of the articles mentioning “confidence interval” in some form in the abstract:\n\n\nTable 1: Number of articles for which at least one effect is retrieved (out of those containing the phrase ‘CI’)\n\n\nEffect retreived\n\n\nNumber of articles\n\n\nProportion\n\n\nYes\n\n\n784\n\n\n0.8769575\n\n\nNo\n\n\n110\n\n\n0.1230425\n\n\nNote that a bunch of abstracts contain the phrase “CI” without actually displaying effects and confidence intervals. Our algorithm seems to make a reasonably good job at detecting effects and CI when they are indeed displayed in an abstract. In addition, there is no reason to think that our ability to detect an effect would be correlated with power issues in the paper. Hence, we feel rather confident assuming that our detection algorithm selects a random (along our dimension of interest) sample of estimates among all estimates displayed in abstracts.\nRepresentativity of articles for which an effect was retrieved\nIn this subsection, we investigate whether there are systematic differences between articles for which we retrieved an effect and articles that do not display an effect in their abstract or for which we did not detect one. We build this analysis such that it also provides general information about the entire set of articles.\nQualitative random analysis\nFirst of all, we skim through a bunch of abstracts for which we retrieve an effect or not to see whether there are clear differences across study subsets.\nFirst of all, we notice that we did not select some papers displaying effects in their abstracts because they do not mention confidence intervals. We need standard errors to compute power, type M and type S error, hence why we did not select these papers. A small part of them seem to however mention p-values. We could have build on this to increase slightly our set of articles considered but it would not have drastically increased the set of articles considered. As discussed previously, we also acknowledge that our algorithm fails to detect a small share of otherwise valid estimates.\nWe then noticed that a non negligible share of articles for which we do not detect an effect seem to to be off-topic. Our quick exploration did not show evidence of such an issue in articles for which we detected an effect. This is rather reassuring; we are filtering out non well suited papers.\nFinally, part of the studies for which we do not detect an effect are metanalyses (based on a quick regex search, there are about twice has much metanalyses in articles with an effect). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublication date\nGetting back to our automatic analysis, we first look into the distribution of published articles on this topic in time. We also wonder whether displaying effects in the abstract was a particular feature of a given period.\n\n\n\nFirst, we notice that the number of articles published on short-term health effects of air pollution has been increasing rather strongly since the 1980s. The first article for which an effect is detected was published in 1992. We only found 12 articles published before 1992. This can be explained by the fact that, in most places, air pollution has only been measured consistently since the 1990s.\nEven though there are slightly more recent (2010-2020) articles for which effects are retrieved, the difference does not seem to be substantial. Distributions of articles for which an effect has been retrieved and not are rather similar.\nJournal and fields\nWe then look into the journals and academic fields in which articles on short term health effect of air pollution have been published. The results by journals are rather messy so we focus on journal areas and subareas.\n\n\n\nMost papers on this topic have been, unsurprisingly, published in multidisciplinary journals, health or physical science journals.\nOne may notice that effects are not retrieved, ie not reported in the abstract or not detected, for most papers published in life science and social sciences and humanities. This is probably due to reporting practices peculiar to these fields. This might not be as problematic as they constitute a small share of the sample. There does not seem to be a particularly large imbalance in terms of journal general field for the more represented fields.\nThemes\nWe then wonder if the words used in each sets of abstracts differ between the two sets of articles.\n\n\n\nApart from a few key terms, such as CI, 95 for instance, there are no huge differences in the terms used in both subsets of abstracts. Noticeably, the term “increase” seems to appear more in abstracts where we detect an effect. This is not surprising as these papers often use sentences similar to “a 10 \\(\\mu g/m^{3}\\) increase in PM10 concentration lead to …”.\nPollutant\nWe then look at the pollutants considered in each article. We consider that a pollutant is studied if it is mentioned in the abstract. It is not an exact measure as some articles may mention pollutants without actually studying them but it remains an interesting metric.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, we notice that a large share of papers considered here study particulate matters (PM2.5, PM10 or both).\nIt seems that, when the number of papers sudying a given pollutant is large, the likelihood of detecting an effect does not seem to vary much with the type of pollutant. Importantly, the proportion of effects retrieved is much lower for articles for which we are not able to detect the type of pollutants studied.\nOutcome\nAs for pollutants, for some articles, we were able to retrieve studied outcomes depending on the words used in an abstract. We classified them into two categories: mortality and emergency.\n\n\n\nMost articles studied here are interested in mortality. The proportion of articles for which an effect is retrieved seems to be larger for papers studying emergency admissions than mortality. There might therefore be some kind of selection issue along this dimension.\nSubpopulation\nSome articles focus on sub-populations such as infants or elders. When these terms are not mentioned, either the entire population is considered or we are not able to detect the subgroup considered. The number of articles for which a subpopulation is indicated is rather small:\n\n\nSubpopulation indicated\n\n\nNumber of articles\n\n\nYes\n\n\n238\n\n\nNo or unknown\n\n\n1596\n\n\nLooking more in details into the detection of effects, we get the following pattern:\n\n\n\nThere does not seem to be large variations in the proportion of articles for which an effect is detected, depending on whether a subpopulation is studied or not. Yet, this proportion is a slightly larger for elders than infants, itself larger than when when no subpopulation is detected.\nNumber of observations\nWe then look at the number of observations, the length of the the study period and the number of cities considered. Importantly, we only retrieve this information for a very limited subset of articles.\n\n\nMissing\n\n\nLength of the study\n\n\nNumber of cities\n\n\nNumber of observations\n\n\nFalse\n\n\n630\n\n\n832\n\n\n375\n\n\nTrue\n\n\n1204\n\n\n1002\n\n\n1459\n\n\nOur analysis is therefore to be taken with caution as there is a critical lack of information for this category.\n\n\n\nWe notice that there are large variations in the number of observations in the studies considered. However, there does not seem to be large differences along this dimension on whether an effect is retrieved or not. There seems however to be more studies around 1000 observations and less between 10,000 and 100,000 in articles for which an effect is retrieved. This is explained by the fact effects are retrieved more for studies with rather limited study period (around 3 years).\nSummary\nThe articles for which an effect was detected, unsurprisingly, seem to be slightly different from those for which we did not detect one, based on our quick qualitative analysis. Yet, there does not seem to be important divides along the dimensions studied.\nWe can thus now dig further into the analysis of the estimates retrieved.\nAnalysis of the effects\nIn this section, we briefly analyze the effects retrieved, their statistical significance and their precision.\nSignificance\nFirst, we notice that most of the effects retrieved here are significant (at the usual 5% threshold).\n\n\nSignificant\n\n\nNumber of effects\n\n\nProportion\n\n\nNo\n\n\n167\n\n\n0.0626407\n\n\nYes\n\n\n2499\n\n\n0.9373593\n\n\nResearchers mention their key findings in the abstract and therefore probably do not report in their abstracts non statistically significant estimates for which the null hypothesis of no effect cannot be rejected. Only a very small proportion of articles do not report any statistically significant estimates in their abstract:\n\n\nAt least one significant estimate\n\n\nNumber of articles\n\n\nProportion\n\n\nNo\n\n\n12\n\n\n0.0147239\n\n\nYes\n\n\n803\n\n\n0.9852761\n\n\nT-scores\nWe then look into the distribution of the t-scores.\n\n\n\nThere seems to be some sort of bunching for t-scores above 1.96. In this analysis, we only consider estimates reported in the abstracts. Authors may only report significant estimates in their abstracts even though they also report non significant estimates in the body of the article. This might explain this bunching. We need to investigate this further in order to understand whether this bunching is evidence of publication bias. To do so, we could reproduce the present analysis but analyze the full texts and not only on the abstracts. Other techniques could be used to analyze reporting bias but are not available to us, considering the lack on information we have access to using this automatic method.\nSignal to noise ratio\nWe then plot the distribution of the signal to noise ratio, ie the ratio of the point estimate and the width of the confidence interval.\n\n\n\nThe graph is of course analogous to the previous one. It however underlines that in a large share of the studies, the magnitude of the noise is larger than the magnitude of the effect. We then look into the distribution of the signal to noise ratio in more details.\n\n\nSignal to noise ratio\n\n\nPercentage of estimates with a lower signal to noise ratio\n\n\n0.0235294\n\n\n0%\n\n\n0.5133428\n\n\n10%\n\n\n0.6129032\n\n\n20%\n\n\n0.7349456\n\n\n30%\n\n\n0.9045643\n\n\n40%\n\n\n1.1627137\n\n\n50%\n\n\n1.5901639\n\n\n60%\n\n\n2.7950737\n\n\n70%\n\n\n6.5294118\n\n\n80%\n\n\n23.7592495\n\n\n90%\n\n\n834.8333333\n\n\n100%\n\n\nWe notice that for about 55% of the estimates considered here, the magnitude of the noise is more important than those of the signal. This is particularly concerning.\nPower analysis\nWe then turn to the power analysis itself. The objective is to evaluate the power, type M and type S errors for each estimate.\nTo compute these values, we would need to know the true effect size. Yet, true effects are of course unknown. One solution could be to use estimates from the literature and meta-analyses as best guesses for these true values. Yet, in the setting of this automatic literature review, detecting what is exactly measured in each analysis is particularly challenging since there is no standardized way of reporting the results beyond mentioning confidence intervals. One study may for instance claim that a 10 \\(\\mu g/m^{3}\\) increase in PM2.5 concentration is associated with an increase of x% in hospital admissions over the course of a day while another study may state that a 2% increase in ozone concentration increases the number of deaths by 3 over a month. Fortunately, for each estimate retrieved, even though we do not know what is measured, we can evaluate the precision with which it is estimated.\nTo circumvent the fact that we do not know the actual effect size, we follow a strategy suggested by Gelman and Carlin (2014). We consider a range of potential “true” effect sizes and run a sensitivity analysis. We investigate what would be the power, type M and type S error if the true effect was only a fraction of the measured effect. This enables us to assess whether the design of the study would be good enough to detect a smaller effect. If assuming that the true effect is 3/4 of the measured effect yields a power of 30%, there is probably a major issue with the design of this study. With this design, this (non zero) effect would only be detected 30% of the time.\nOf course, there is no reason to think a priori that a given effect would be overestimated. The values for power, type M and type S errors are therefore only informative.\nTo carry out the analysis, we use the package retrodesign which computes post analysis design calculations (power, type M and type S errors). We run the function retro_desing() for several effect sizes.\n\n\n\nIn a first part, we investigate whether the literature might be subject to design issues. We analyze the distribution of power, type M and type S errors in the whole set of abstracts, how they evolve jointly or along several variables such as the size of the true effect. We find clear evidence of heterogeneity across articles. Some of them seem to present robust designs while others seem much more problematic, yielding low power and high rates of type M error, even for large hypothesized true effect sizes.  Thus, in a second part, we investigate potential sources of heterogeneity.\nGraphical analysis\nWe first explore graphically the distribution of power, type M and type S error across simulations and for different magnitudes of the true effect.\n\n\n\nA large chunk of articles display high power and low rates of type M and type S error, in each robustness check. This is reassuring: a good chunk of the literature does not seem to suffer from low power issues! Type S error does not seem to be an important issue in this literature. However, a non negligible number of articles display low power and/or some evidence of type M error.\nNote that for type M errors, due to some outliers, we used a log scale. Without this log scale and restricting our sample to type M errors lower than 2.5, we get the following graph:\n\n\n\nWe find that, even if the measured effect was close to the true effect, for a good chunk of articles, there would be a substantial risk of type M error. That means that, replicating each of these studies would yield, on average, a smaller effect than the reported one.\nAlternatively, we can also look at what would be the power, type M and type S if the true effect was equal to the lower bound of the confidence interval. This metric may exacerbate design issues for imprecise estimates. Such estimates would be “penalized” twice for being imprecise: they have a large standard error and the hypothesized true effect would be very small. Yet, this metric remains interesting as confidence intervals describe credible effect sizes. If the effect size is smaller but still credible, would the design be good enough to “detect” it?\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, the conclusions remain similar: most articles do not seems to suffer from power issues but a non negligible chunk of articles does.\nTable\nWe then look more precisely at actual numbers, looking at the median and mean power, type M and type S errors for different true effect sizes.\n\n\n\n“True” effect\n\n\n\n\nPower\n\n\n\n\nType M\n\n\n\n\nType S\n\n\n\n\n\nMean\n\n\nMedian\n\n\nMean\n\n\nMedian\n\n\nMean\n\n\nMedian\n\n\n1% of the measured effect\n\n\n0.1098429\n\n\n0.0502380\n\n\n68.736056\n\n\n51.305715\n\n\n0.3610377\n\n\n0.4469236\n\n\n5% of the measured effect\n\n\n0.2185136\n\n\n0.0559704\n\n\n13.891964\n\n\n10.322415\n\n\n0.2133374\n\n\n0.2562077\n\n\n10% of the measured effect\n\n\n0.2854514\n\n\n0.0741190\n\n\n7.088445\n\n\n5.236283\n\n\n0.1257028\n\n\n0.1059307\n\n\n33% of the measured effect\n\n\n0.4947949\n\n\n0.3245051\n\n\n2.436112\n\n\n1.737081\n\n\n0.0197135\n\n\n0.0008199\n\n\n50% of the measured effect\n\n\n0.6170604\n\n\n0.6251308\n\n\n1.788413\n\n\n1.266145\n\n\n0.0087967\n\n\n0.0000180\n\n\n67% of the measured effect\n\n\n0.7176892\n\n\n0.8629759\n\n\n1.490592\n\n\n1.083232\n\n\n0.0053314\n\n\n0.0000003\n\n\n75% of the measured effect\n\n\n0.7572823\n\n\n0.9276366\n\n\n1.403188\n\n\n1.043436\n\n\n0.0044629\n\n\n0.0000000\n\n\n90% of the measured effect\n\n\n0.8189661\n\n\n0.9839067\n\n\n1.288970\n\n\n1.009967\n\n\n0.0033833\n\n\n0.0000000\n\n\n100% of the measured effect\n\n\n0.8517684\n\n\n0.9953098\n\n\n1.236439\n\n\n1.003011\n\n\n0.0028919\n\n\n0.0000000\n\n\nLower bound of the CI\n\n\n0.6176972\n\n\n0.8309933\n\n\n5.607090\n\n\n1.103965\n\n\n0.0448271\n\n\n0.0000006\n\n\nECDF\nEmpirical Cumulative Distribution Functions (ECDFs) provide a broader perspective on these metrics. They inform us of the share of articles for which power, type M or S errors are below a given threshold.\n\n\n\nWe notice that about 40% of estimates would not reach the conventional 80% statistical power level if the true effect is 3/4 the size of the measured effect. This is rather concerning.\nFor ECDFs too we look at what would be the power, type M and type S error if the true effect was equal to the lower bound of the confidence interval or to the estimated effect.\n\n\n\nThis might be rather concerning: even if the true effect was equal to the estimated effect (and only considering statistically significant estimates), 22.2992254% of the estimates would not reach the conventional a 80% power threshold. This is rather concerning since, due to type M error, significant estimates likely over-estimate on average the true effects. Indeed, the median type M for these estimates is 1.2501204. Considering that the true effect is equal to the estimated effect is therefore very conservative. If we assume that the true effect is equal to 3/4 of the measured effect (which is still rather conservative), the proportion of significant estimates not reaching the 80% power conventional threshold is still as high as 37.3420302%\nLink between power, type M and type S error\nWe then look how type M and type S error evolve with power for the estimates considered.\n\n\n\nThere is a one-to-one relationship between power and type M and type S error. Not surprisingly, type M and type S errors skyrocket in studies with low power. Restricting the sample to a maximum type M of 4, we notice how quickly type M error rises when power decreases. In general, and not restricting ourselves to this literature, type M error starts becoming a preoccupying issue even for rather high values of power. Unfortunately, there is no conventional limit for which type M error is considered to be problematic. We should probably define one. Interestingly, when power is equal to the conventional 80% threshold, type M error is around 1.125.\n\n\n\nDesign calculations and effect size\nWe then investigate how average power, type M and type S evolve as a proportion of the true effect size.\n\n\n\nPower decreases and type M and type S errors skyrocket for small values of the true effect (as a proportion of the measured effect). In addition, the average power in the literature would be lower than 80% in the true effect was about 0.85 the measured effect for each study. This is rather preoccupying since, if the true effect was about 0.85 the measured effect for each study, on average, effect would be overestimated by more than 30%. Type S error only seems to be an issue for very small values of the true effect as a portion of the measured effect. Type M error seems to be more consistently problematic. The shoot up in the previous graph makes it difficult to read the values of type M error when the true effect is not a small portion of the measured effect. We therefore zoom in.\n\n\n\nWe notice that, on average in the literature, the treatment effects are overestimated, even for large values of the true effect. This result might be linked to some outliers. We thus look at the evolution of the median power and type M with true effect size.\n\n\n\nThe issue is much less important when looking at the median. This also highlights the presence of heterogeneity in terms of power in the literature. It is likely that some papers suffer from important issues and drive up the mean while others are not to prone to this type of issues.\nTo confirm that, we look into the evolution of the distribution of power and type M error with the proportion of effect size.\n\n\n\nThe overall distribution of power may seem surprising: for “large” effect sizes, the power of most studies is high while it suddenly shifts to very low as effect size decreases.\nSummary\nTo sum up, the bulk of the estimates in this literature does not seem to suffer from low power and type M error issues. For most estimates, type S error does not seem to be an important issue in this literature. Yet, even if the measured effect was close to the true effect, a non negligible chunk of articles would display low power and a substantial risk of type M error. The power of a large chunk of estimates, at least one quarter of significant ones, might be problematically low. This low power is associated with non negligible type M error. Part of the estimates are thus likely overestimated.\nWe need to investigate further into the sources of this heterogeneity.\nAnalysis of the sources of heterogeneity\nTo simplify and clarify our analysis, we consider that an estimate has low power if its computed power is lower than 80% if the true effect is 3/4 of the measured effect. These numbers are arbitrary. 80% is the threshold usually used in power analyses and 3/4 is purely arbitrary and could be changed easily in a robustness check. Following this criterion, the number and proportion of estimates with low power is as follows:\n\n\nPower\n\n\nNumber of estimates\n\n\nProportion\n\n\nAdequate power\n\n\n1537\n\n\n0.5765191\n\n\nLow power\n\n\n1129\n\n\n0.4234809\n\n\nBased this criterion, the number of studies with low power is concernedly high.\nSuch articles are also associated with large type M errors:\n\n\nPower\n\n\nMean type M\n\n\nMedian type M\n\n\nAdequate power\n\n\n1.013800\n\n\n1.000000\n\n\nLow power\n\n\n1.933293\n\n\n1.469107\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe investigate the particularities of articles with seemingly low power. We basically reproduce the same analyses as the ones used to compare articles for which we retrieved an effect or not.\nPublication date\nFirst, we look into the evolution of the proportion of articles with low power with publication dates.\n\n\n\nThe proportion of articles with low power does not seem to have drastically evolved in time. One may have expected that this proportion would have decreased in time as researchers have access to more and more data, computational power and as estimation methods improve. \nWe can also look more generally at how power, type M and type S error evolved in time.\n\n\n\nThere does not seem to be a clear trend in the evolution of power and type S error. However, type M error seems to increase slightly in time. This is rather concerning. One may potentially explain that by the fact that the literature is chasing smaller and smaller effects, leading to more type M error. This hypothesis is however difficult to verify since the effects we retrieved are not standardized, as mentioned previously.\nCarrying out an analysis by quantile clearly shows that this evolution is driven by outliers with vary large type M errors. The yearly maximum type M error rates have increased in recent years.\n\n\n\nJournal and fields\nWe then look into the distribution of articles in journals and fields. We filter out articles from life sciences and social sciences & humanities journals since only a very limited number of articles have been published in such journals.\n\n\n\nIt seems that articles published in health sciences journals are less prone to power issues than articles published in other types of journals. This is somehow confirmed when looking at more precise subjects: the proportion of articles displaying low power is much lower in medicine journals than in “environment” and “chemistry” journals.\nSome of the heterogeneity may come from the leniency of the journals with regards to these issues. Interestingly, not many fields have a very low rate of articles with low power. This might reveal an across the board lack of awareness of power issues. Yet, while our knowledge of the medicine literature is extremely limited, we seem to remember that, when applying for randomized experiments, researchers in medicine have to perform power calculations in order to properly design their study. Some of them therefore pay carefull attention to power issues and this might explain the lower rate of articles with low power in such journals.\nThemes\nWe then investigate whether the themes appearing in the abstracts are different in articles with adequate or low power.\n\n\n\nThere does not seem to be a clear difference in the terms used in abstracts for articles with low and adequate power. The only noticeable difference, not visible in this graph, is the use of the term “relative”. Articles with low power mention it much less that articles with adequate power. This difference is rather unclear.\nPollutant\nWe also look into potential disparities in terms of pollutant:\n\n\n\nThere does not seem to be stark differences by pollutant type. While some differences seem to appear for BC and Air Quality Index, these pollutants are only studied in a limited sample of studies.\nOutcome\nWe then compare the power as a function of the outcome studied (mortality or hospital admissions).\n\n\n\nThere does not seem to be any heterogeneity along this dimension.\nSubpopulation\nWe then turn to the sub-population studied.\n\n\n\nThere does not seem to be stark variations along this dimension either.\nNumber of observations\nFinally, we explore the link between power and the number of observations. Remember that, for a lot of articles, we were not able to recover information about the number of observations (number of cities or length of the study). Hence, these results are purely suggestive.\n\n\n\nThere does not seem to be substantial heterogeneity in terms of number of observations or length of the study period (at least in articles for which we were able to retrieve this information). We may not observe any difference in terms of number of observations because we do not have this information for many studies. We have retrieved more data about the number of cities considered and it seems that more studies with low power only consider one city. The data are imperfect but this result may come from the fact that estimates from studies focusing on one city are likely to be less precise than those from studies focusing on several cities. This would be due to a smaller number of observations.\nSummary\nWe have seem that mean and median power do not seem to have greatly evolved in time but the average type M seems to have increased in time. This pattern seems to be driven by the fact that more and more papers with very large type M errors have been published recently. We have also seen that health science journals seem to be more prone to power issues than other journals. However, there seems to be a shared lack of concern for low power issues across all fields. Finally, we did not find evidence of obvious heterogeneity in outcome, pollutant or sub-population studied but noticed that more studies with low power only seem to be considering only one city.\nConclusion and summary\nIn this document, we analyze the statistical power and inference properties of the literature on short term health effects of air pollution. To do so, we retrieved 2666 valid estimates from abstracts of this literature. This sample of estimates is likely rather representative of the whole set of estimates in abstracts of this literature.\nOur results are both reassuring and worrying. A large chunk of the estimates in this literature does not seem to suffer from low power and type M error issues. Yet, even if the measured effect was close to the true effect, a non negligible chunk of articles would display low power and a substantial risk of type M error. Type S error does not seem to be an important issue in this literature. The following graphs summarise part of this information:\n\n\n\nAbout 40% of estimates would not reach the conventional 80% statistical power level threshold if the true effect is 3/4 the size of the measured effect. If for all studies, the true effect was 3/4 of the measured effect, the mean type M would be about 1.4. Again, this average hides a lot of heterogeneity. For the 40% of estimates with low power mentioned above, the average type M is 1.93, the median is 1.47.\nWe then investigated the sources of heterogeneity. Concernedly, we find that in recent years, more and more articles display very large type M errors. In addition, health science journals seem to be more prone to power issues than other journals. However, there seems to be a shared lack of concern for low power issues across all fields. Finally, we did not find evidence of obvious heterogeneity in outcome, pollutant or sub-population studied but noticed that more studies with low power only seem to be considering only one city.\n\n\n\n",

We take advantage of a somehow standardized reporting mechanism to retrieve point estimates and confidence intervals from the abstracts using REGular EXPressions (regex).\nThe algorithm we wrote is not perfect: it probably does not detect all estimates and may pick up some incorrect point estimates and/or standard error. However, based on quick non-automatic checks we ran, these potential issues seem very limited. Retrieving all this information via careful reading of the abstracts would have been extremely cumbersome. This automatic analysis is an important time saver. Importantly, the analysis carried out for this literature could be easily replicated for another literature, based on the code used and described in this document.\nSelecting articles and retrieving metadata\nWe use the fulltext package to get the abstract of each article corresponding to our search query. \nWe focus on articles published on Scopus and Pubmed. To access Scopus API, one needs to register to get an API key (stored in the .Renviron) for Elsevier and a Crossref TDM API key.  Pubmed articles are accessed via Entrez. An API key enables to increase the number of requests per seconds from 3 to 10. More information on authentication is available on the fulltext manual.\nSet of articles to consider\nFirst of all, we need to clearly define the set of articles we want to consider in this analysis. Our search query is:\n‘TITLE((“air pollution” OR “air quality” OR “particulate matter” OR ozone OR “nitrogen dioxide” OR “sulfur dioxide” OR “PM10” OR “PM2.5” OR “carbon dioxide” OR “carbon monoxide”) AND (“emergency” OR “mortality” OR “stroke” OR “cerebrovascular” OR “cardiovascular” OR “death” OR “hospitalization”) AND NOT (“long term” OR “long-term”)) AND “short term”’\n\n\nquery <- \n  paste('TITLE((\"air pollution\" OR \"air quality\" OR \"particulate matter\" OR \"ozone\"', \n        'OR \"nitrogen dioxide\" OR \"sulfur dioxide\" OR \"PM10\" OR \"PM2.5\" OR', \n        ' \"carbon dioxide\" OR \"carbon monoxide\")', \n        'AND (\"emergency\" OR \"mortality\" OR \"stroke\" OR \"cerebrovascular\" OR', \n        '\"cardiovascular\" OR \"death\" OR \"hospitalization\")' ,\n        'AND NOT (\"long term\" OR \"long-term\")) AND \"short term\"'\n  )\n\nopts_entrez <- list(use_history = TRUE)\n\n#Run a search\nsearch <- ft_search(query, from = \"scopus\", limit = 2000)\nsearch_entrez <- ft_search(\n  str_replace(query, \"AND NOT\", \"NOT\"), \n  from = \"entrez\", \n  limit = 300, \n  entrezopts = opts_entrez\n)\n\n\n\nWe then retrieve and wrangle the related metadata. The metadata from different sources having different shapes, we only select a few relevant columns to build an overall metadata set.\n\n\nmetadata_scopus <- search$scopus$data %>% \n  as_tibble() %>% \n  rename_all(function(x) str_remove_all(names(.), \"prism:|dc:\")) %>% \n  rename_all(function(x) str_replace_all(names(.), \"-\", \"_\")) %>% \n  select(doi, title, creator, publicationName, pubmed_id, coverDate) %>% \n  rename(\n    authors = creator,\n    journal = publicationName\n  ) %>% \n  mutate(\n    pubmed_id = ifelse(!str_detect(pubmed_id, \"[0-9]{7}\"), NA, pubmed_id),\n    pub_date = ymd(coverDate)\n  ) %>% \n  select(-coverDate)\n\nsaveRDS(metadata_scopus, \"R/Outputs/metadata_scopus.RDS\")\n\nmetadata_entrez <- search_entrez$entrez$data %>% #search_entrez$entrez$data \n  as_tibble() %>% \n  # rename(id = uid) %>% \n  select(doi, title, authors, fulljournalname, pmid, pubdate) %>% \n  rename(\n    journal = fulljournalname,\n    pubmed_id = pmid\n  ) %>% \n  mutate(\n    pubmed_id = ifelse(!str_detect(pubmed_id, \"[0-9]{7}\"), NA, pubmed_id),\n    pub_date = ymd(pubdate)\n  ) %>% \n  select(-pubdate)\n\nsaveRDS(metadata_entrez, \"R/Outputs/metadata_entrez.RDS\")\n\nmetadata_lit_review <- metadata_scopus %>% \n  rbind(metadata_entrez) %>% \n  filter(!is.na(doi)) %>% \n  mutate(pb_doi = str_detect(doi, \"[<>;]\")) %>% #some dois are not valid\n  filter(pb_doi == FALSE) %>% \n  select(-pb_doi) %>% \n  group_by(doi) %>% \n  filter(pub_date == max(pub_date, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% #some articles have been published twice\n  mutate(n_with_doi = n()) %>% \n  filter(n_with_doi == 1 | (n_with_doi > 1 & pubmed_id == max(pubmed_id, na.rm = TRUE))) %>%\n  #two weird articles with separate author names, I select one randomly\n  select(-n_with_doi) %>% \n  ungroup() %>%\n  distinct(title, .keep_all = TRUE)\n\n# saveRDS(metadata_lit_review, \"R/Outputs/metadata_lit_review.RDS\")\n\n\n\nRetreiving abstracts\nThere is no fulltext function to access abstracts from Entrez. Therefore, using the DOI, we get the abstracts from Semantic Scholar. We also access Scopus abstracts from Semantic Scholar since, due to an IP address constraint we cannot access the texts and abstracts from Scopus.\nIn Semantic Scholar, there is a rate limit of 100 articles per 5 min or 20 articles per minute. We therefore need to pause the system to be able to download everything. In addition, some DOIs are not valid so we filtered them out in a previous step (pb_doi).1\n\n\nget_abstracts <- function(doi) {\n  vect_doi <- unique(doi)\n  number_periods <- (length(vect_doi) - 1) %/% 20\n  abs <- NULL\n\n  message(str_c(\"Total downloading time: \", number_periods, \"min\"))\n  \n  for (i in 0:number_periods) {\n    \n    doi_period <- vect_doi[(20*i+1):(20*(i+1))]\n    doi_period <- doi_period[!is.na(doi_period)]\n    \n    skip_to_next <- FALSE #to handle issues, using tryCatch\n    \n    possible_error <- tryCatch(\n      abs_period <- doi_period %>%\n        ft_abstract(from = \"semanticscholar\") %>%\n        .$semanticscholar %>%\n        as_tibble() %>%\n        unnest(cols = everything()) %>%\n        pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = \"doi\", values_to = \"abstract\") %>%\n        filter(doi != abstract),\n      error = function(e) e\n    )\n    \n    if (inherits(possible_error, \"error\")) {\n      warning(\n        str_c(\"The abstracts for the following articles could not be downloaded: \",\n              str_c(doi_period, collapse = \",\")))\n      next\n    } else {\n       abs <- abs %>%\n        rbind(abs_period)\n    }\n    \n    if (i < number_periods & number_periods != 0) {\n      message(str_c(\"Remaining time: \", (number_periods - i), \"min\"))\n      Sys.sleep(63)\n    }\n  } \n  \n  return(abs)\n}\n\n#run this from the console to see the time remaining (copy/paste it)\nabstracts <- metadata_lit_review %>%\n  .$doi %>% \n  get_abstracts()  %>% \n  left_join(metadata_lit_review, by = \"doi\") \n\n# saveRDS(abstracts, \"R/Outputs/abstracts.RDS\")\n\n\n\nRetreiving effects and confidence interavals\nNow that we have retrieved the abstracts, we want to extract the effects and associated confidence intervals. Part of the literature, displays directly effects and 95% confidence intervals in their abstracts.2 We identify effects and CIs as follows:\nCI: any couple of numbers following by less than 4 characters a string describing a confidence interval (“95%”, “CI”, “confidence interval”). We also consider confidence intervals of the shape “(-8.7, 54.7)”: it needs to have a shape “(number separator number)” and needs to be preceded by a number, less than 5 characters away.\nEffect: the first number preceding by less than 30 characters a similar string describing a confidence interval (apart numbers used to describe the “95” of a 95% CI).\n\n\nstring_confint <- str_c(\n  \"((?<!(\\\\d\\\\.|\\\\d))95\\\\s?%|(?<!(\\\\d\\\\.|\\\\d))95\\\\s(per(\\\\s?)cent)|\",\n  \"\\\\bC(\\\\.)?(I|l)(\\\\.)?(s?)\\\\b|\\\\bPI(s?)\\\\b|\\\\b(i|I)nterval|\",\n  \"\\\\b(c|C)onfidence\\\\s(i|I)nterval|\\\\b(c|C)redible\\\\s(i|I)nterval|\", \n  \"\\\\b(p|P)osterior\\\\s(i|I)nterval)\"\n  )\nnum_confint <- \n  \"(-\\\\s?|−\\\\s?)?[\\\\d\\\\.]{1,7}[–\\\\s:\\\\~;,%\\\\-to\\\\‐-]{1,5}(-\\\\s?|−\\\\s?)?[\\\\d\\\\.]{1,7}\"\nnum_effect <- \"(-\\\\s?|−\\\\s?)?[\\\\d\\\\.]{1,7}\"\n\ndetected_effects <- abstracts %>%\n  mutate(abstract = str_replace_all(abstract, \"·\", \".\")) %>%\n  select(doi, abstract) %>%\n  unnest_tokens(\n    sentence,\n    abstract,\n    token = \"sentences\",\n    to_lower = FALSE,\n    drop = FALSE\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(\n    # contains_CI = str_detect(sentence, string_confint),\n    sentence = str_replace_all(\n      sentence,\n      \"(?<=(?<!\\\\.)(?<!\\\\d)\\\\d{1,4}),(?=(\\\\d{3}(?!\\\\.)))\",\n      \"\"\n    )\n  ) %>%\n  # filter(contains_CI) %>%\n  mutate(\n    CI = str_extract_all(\n      sentence,\n      str_c(\n        \"((?<=\", string_confint, \"[^\\\\d]{0,4})\", num_confint,\")|\",\n        \"(?<=\", num_effect,\"[^\\\\d\\\\.]{0,5})\", \n        \"(?<=(\\\\(|\\\\[))\", num_confint,\"(?=%?[\\\\)\\\\];])\"\n      )\n    ),\n    effect = str_extract_all(\n      sentence,\n      str_c(\n        num_effect,\n        \"(?=[^\\\\d\\\\.]{0,30}([^\\\\.\\\\d]\", string_confint,\"))(?<![^\\\\.\\\\d]95)|\",\n        num_effect,\n        \"(?=[^\\\\d\\\\.]{0,5}(\\\\(|\\\\[)\", num_confint, \"(?=%?[\\\\)\\\\];]))(?<![^\\\\.\\\\d]95)\"\n      )\n    )\n  ) \n\n\n\nThese lines of code return a set of confidence intervals and effects for each sentence containing the phrase (“CI”, “confidence interval”, etc).  For now, if we do not detect the same number of effects and confidence interval in a sentence, we drop the sentence, even though there are 5 pairs of effect-CI and only one of them is badly detected.\nNote that some problems might remain with our estimates and CIs detected. Yet, a vast majority of estimates seems to be correctly detected. Here are examples of the confidence intervals and effects detected using our current method:\n\n\nsentences_with_CI <- detected_effects %>% \n  filter(CI != \"character(0)\" & effect != \"character(0)\")\nrandom_sentences <- sample(1:length(sentences_with_CI$sentence), 5)\nstr_view_all(\n  sentences_with_CI$sentence[random_sentences],\n  str_c(\n    num_effect,\n    \"(?=[^\\\\d\\\\.]{0,17}([^\\\\.\\\\d]\", string_confint, \"))(?<![^\\\\.\\\\d]95)|\",\n    num_effect,\n    \"(?=[^\\\\d\\\\.]{0,5}(\\\\(|\\\\[)\", num_confint, \"(?=%?[\\\\)\\\\];]))(?<![^\\\\.\\\\d]95)\",\n    \"|((?<=\", string_confint, \"[^\\\\d]{0,4})\", num_confint,\")|\",\n    \"(?<=\", num_effect,\"[^\\\\d\\\\.]{0,5})(?<=(\\\\(|\\\\[))\", num_confint, \"(?=%?[\\\\)\\\\];])\"\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"html\":\"<ul>\\n  <li>Results The excess risk for non-accidental mortality was <span class='match'>1.3<\\/span>% [95% confidence interval (CI), <span class='match'>0.8–1.7<\\/span>] per 10 μg/m3 of PM10, with higher excess risks for cardiovascular and above age 65 mortality of <span class='match'>1.9<\\/span>% (95% CI, <span class='match'>0.8–3.0<\\/span>) and <span class='match'>1.5<\\/span>% (95% CI, <span class='match'>0.9–2.1<\\/span>), respectively.<\\/li>\\n  <li>After adjustment, top (hazard ratio [HR], <span class='match'>1.48<\\/span>; 95% confidence interval [CI], <span class='match'>1.08-2.04<\\/span>; P=.016) and bottom (HR, <span class='match'>1.54<\\/span>; 95% CI, <span class='match'>1.08-2.18<\\/span>; P=.017) quartiles of BE were associated with increased risk of readmission or death.<\\/li>\\n  <li>On admission days with SO2 levels above the median, mortality was higher (OR <span class='match'>1.13<\\/span>; 95% CI <span class='match'>1.10, 1.16<\\/span>) at <span class='match'>12.2<\\/span>% (95% CI <span class='match'>11.4, 13<\\/span>) compared with <span class='match'>10.7<\\/span>% (95% CI <span class='match'>10.3, 11.1<\\/span>) on days when SO2 levels were below the median.<\\/li>\\n  <li>Using these methods, we estimated <span class='match'>362000<\\/span> (95% confidence interval, <span class='match'>173000–551000<\\/span>) annual global premature cardiopulmonary deaths attributable to ozone, approximately 50% of the 700000 premature deaths we calculated in our original study (Anenberg et al.<\\/li>\\n  <li>During the period of high PM10 concentration (>89.82 μg/m3), NO2 demonstrated its strongest effect for total non-accidental mortality (ERR%: <span class='match'>0.92<\\/span>, 95% CI: <span class='match'>0.42–1.42<\\/span>) and cardiovascular disease mortality (ERR%: <span class='match'>1.20<\\/span>, 95% CI: <span class='match'>0.38–2.03<\\/span>).<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\nOnce the effects and CI are identified, some wrangling is necessary in order to get the data into a usable format.

We retrieved 2666 valid point estimates and associated confidence intervals. We analyze them further in another document.\nRetreiving additional information\nIt might also be interesting to have information about the type of pollutant considered in the study, the study period, the number of observations or the type of outcome studied (mortality, emergency admissions, stroke, cerebrovascular or cardiovascular diseases). We thus use regex to recover this information. Of course, this does not enable us to retrieve data for all the abstracts considered but it provides a useful source of information; retrieving this information “by hand” is extremely cumbersome. Regex are thus very helpful here. They also make this analysis reproducible.\nNumber of obsrvations\nIn most studies in this field, observations are daily and at the city level. To compute the number of observations, we thus retrieve the length of the study period from the abstract when possible, along with the number of cities considered in the study.\nLength of the study period\nTo compute the length of the study period, we look for beginning and end dates for the period of study in the abstract. Some abstracts contain phrases such as “from January 2002 to March 2011” to indicate the study period. We take advantage of such mentions to retrieve the study period. Before anything, we transform the text data to a date format using the function text_to_date. Then, we detect, the study periods and wrangle them into a usable format. If we retrieve several length for a unique article, we take a conservative approach and only keep the longer one.\n\n\nabstracts_only <- abstracts %>% \n  mutate(abstract = str_replace_all(abstract, \"·\", \".\")) %>% \n  select(doi, abstract)\n\nmonth_regex <- str_c(\n  \"\\\\b(?:Jan(?:uary)?|Feb(?:ruary)?|Mar(?:ch)?|Apr(?:il)?|May|Jun(?:e)?|\", \n  \"Jul(?:y)?|Aug(?:ust)?|Sep(?:tember)?|Oct(?:ober)?|(Nov|Dec)(?:ember)?)\")\ndate_regex <- str_c(\"(\", month_regex, \"\\\\s){0,1}(19|20)\\\\d{2}\")\n\ntext_to_date <- function(date_text) {\n  year <-  str_remove_all(date_text, \"[^\\\\d]\")\n  month <- match(str_remove_all(date_text, \"[\\\\d\\\\s]\"), month.name)\n  month <- ifelse(is.na(month), \"01\", month)\n  date <- dmy(str_c(\"01-\", str_pad(month, width = 2, pad = 0), \"-\", year))\n  return(date)\n}\n\narticles_length_study <- abstracts_only %>%\n  mutate(\n    dates_obs = str_extract_all(\n      abstract, \n      str_c(\n        \"(\", date_regex, \"|\", month_regex, \")\", \n        \"( to |\\\\s?—\\\\s?|\\\\s?-\\\\s?| and )\", \n        date_regex\n      )\n    )\n  ) %>% \n  unnest(dates_obs, keep_empty = TRUE) %>%\n  separate(\n    dates_obs, \n    into = c(\"begin_obs\", \"end_obs\"), \n    \"( to |\\\\s?—\\\\s?|\\\\s?-\\\\s?| and )\"\n  ) %>% \n  mutate(#when begin_obs and end_obs are in the same year, \n    #we only get the month for begin_obs\n    begin_obs = ifelse(\n      !str_detect(begin_obs, \"\\\\d\"), \n      paste(begin_obs, str_remove_all(end_obs, \"[^\\\\d]\")),\n      begin_obs)\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(\n    begin_obs = text_to_date(begin_obs),\n    end_obs = text_to_date(end_obs),\n    length_study = time_length(end_obs - begin_obs, unit = \"days\"),\n    length_study = ifelse(length_study < 0 | end_obs > today(), NA, length_study)\n  ) %>% \n  select(doi, length_study) %>% \n  group_by(doi) %>% \n  mutate(\n    length_study = max(length_study, na.rm = TRUE),\n    length_study = ifelse(length_study < 0, NA, length_study)\n  ) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  distinct()\n\n\n\nWe retrieve a length of the study for 34.351145% of the articles. Note that with this method, we may miss studies which span for exactly a year, eg when only 2011 is mentioned.\nNumber of cities considered\nWe then try to detect the number of cities considered in each abstract. To do so, we use two different techniques:\nWe see whether the abstract uses phrases such as “in 34 cities” and retrieve this 34. We also convert all text-numbers (eg “one”) into their numerical values. When we get several numbers, we take a conservative approach and only keep the largest one.\nWe count the number of cities names appearing uniquely in each abstract. To do so, we use a database of cities names. We restrict our sample to large cities.\n\n\nnumber_word <- tibble(\n  number = 1:5000, \n  word = english::words(1:5000)\n)\n\nabstracts_in_numbers <- abstracts_only %>% \n  unnest_tokens(word, abstract) %>%\n  left_join(number_word, by = \"word\") %>%\n  mutate(word = ifelse(!is.na(number), number, word)) %>% \n  select(-number) %>% \n  group_by(doi) %>% \n  summarize(abstract = str_c(word, collapse = \" \")) %>%\n  ungroup() %>% \n  mutate(abstract = str_remove_all(abstract, \"-\"))\n\n#Source: https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities\nworldcities <- read_csv(\"R/Inputs/worldcities.csv\")\n\nworldcities_large <- worldcities %>%\n  mutate(\n    city_regex = str_c(\"\\\\b\", city_ascii, \"\\\\b\"),\n    city_regex = str_to_lower(city_regex),\n    city_regex = str_remove_all(city_regex, \"-\")\n  ) %>%\n  filter(population > 500000)\n\narticles_number_cities <- abstracts_in_numbers %>% \n   mutate(\n    n_many_cities = str_extract_all(\n      abstract, \n      # \"(?<!more\\\\sthan)\\\\d+(?=\\\\s?(c|C)it(y|ies))\"\n      \"\\\\d+(?=\\\\s?(c|C)it(y|ies))\"\n    ),\n    abstract_ascii = stringi::stri_trans_general(abstract,\"Latin-ASCII\") %>% str_to_lower(),\n    abstract_ascii = str_remove_all(abstract_ascii, \"-\")\n  ) %>%\n  unnest(n_many_cities, keep_empty = TRUE) %>%\n  mutate(n_many_cities = as.numeric(n_many_cities)) %>% \n  group_by(doi) %>%\n  mutate(n_many_cities = max(n_many_cities)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  distinct() %>% \n  group_by(doi) %>%\n  mutate(\n    n_names_cities = str_extract_all(abstract_ascii, worldcities_large[[\"city_regex\"]]) %>% \n      as_vector() %>% \n      unique() %>% \n      length()\n  ) %>%\n  ungroup() %>% \n  group_by(doi) %>% \n  mutate(\n    n_cities = max(n_many_cities, n_names_cities, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n_cities = ifelse(n_cities == 0, NA, n_cities)\n  ) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  select(doi, n_cities) %>% \n  distinct()\n\n\n\nWe retrieve a number of cities considered in the study for 45.3653217% of the articles.\nNumber of observations\nFinally, we combine these two information to compute the number of observations.\n\n\narticles_n_obs <- articles_length_study %>% \n  full_join(articles_number_cities, by = \"doi\") %>% \n  mutate(n_obs = n_cities*length_study)\n\n\n\nWe retrieve a number of cities considered in the study for 20.4471101% of the articles.\nPollutant studied\nWe then recover, when possible, the pollutant(s) considered in the study. We assume that only pollutants studied are mentioned in the abstract. This might be slightly inaccurate but seems to be a coherent first order approximation. We recognize that some pollutants may be mentioned in an abstract even though the corresponding study does not run any analysis on these pollutants and outcomes. We however assume that it is rather unlikely that a study on particulate matter pollution for instance will also talk about ozone in its abstract. Note that there are sometimes several pollutants mentioned in an abstract and analyzed in a study.\n\n\nabstracts_with_titles <- abstracts %>% \n  mutate(\n    abstract = str_replace_all(abstract, \"·\", \".\"),\n    abstract_title = str_c(title, abstract, sep = \". \")\n  ) %>% \n  select(doi, abstract_title)\n\narticles_pollutant <- abstracts_with_titles %>% \n  mutate(\n    pollutant = str_extract_all(\n      abstract_title,\n      str_c(\"(\\\\bPM\\\\s?2(\\\\.|,)5|\\\\bPM\\\\s?10|\\\\bO\\\\s?3\\\\b|\\\\b(o|O)zone\\\\b|\",\n            \"\\\\b(P|p)articulate(\\\\s(M|m)atter\\\\b)?|\\\\bNO\\\\s?2|\",\n            \"\\\\b(n|N)itrogen\\\\s?(d|D)ioxide\\\\b|\\\\bNO\\\\b|\",\n            \"\\\\b(n|N)itrogen\\\\s?(o|O)xide\\\\b|\\\\bNO\\\\s?(x|X)\\\\b|\\\\bSO\\\\s?2|\",\n            \"\\\\bCO\\\\b|\\\\bBC\\\\b|\\\\b(A|a)ir\\\\s(Q|q)uality\\\\s(I|i)ndex\\\\b)\")\n    )\n  ) %>% \n  unnest(pollutant, keep_empty = TRUE) %>% \n  group_by(doi) %>% \n  mutate(\n    pollutant = tolower(pollutant), \n    pollutant = str_replace_all(pollutant, \"\\\\s\", \"\"),\n    pollutant = str_replace_all(pollutant, \",\", \"\\\\.\"),\n    pollutant = case_when(\n      pollutant == \"nitrogendioxide\" ~ \"no2\",\n      pollutant == \"nitrogenoxide\" ~ \"no\", \n      pollutant == \"ozone\" ~ \"o3\",\n      pollutant == \"particulate\" ~ \"particulatematter\",\n      TRUE ~ pollutant\n    ),\n    pollutant = str_to_upper(pollutant),\n    pollutant = ifelse(pollutant == \"PARTICULATEMATTER\", \"Particulate matter\", pollutant),\n    pollutant = ifelse(pollutant == \"AIRQUALITYINDEX\", \"Air Quality Index\", pollutant)\n  ) %>% \n  distinct(pollutant, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  select(-abstract_title) %>% \n  nest(pollutant = pollutant)\n\n\n\nWe identify pollutants considered in the study for 82.4427481% of the articles.\nOutcome considered\nFollowing a similar methodology as for pollutants, we retrieve information about the outcomes considered.\n\n\narticles_outcome <- abstracts_with_titles %>% \n  mutate(\n    outcome = str_extract_all(\n      abstract_title, \n      \"(\\\\b(M|m)ortality\\\\b|\\\\b(D|d)eath(s)?\\\\b|\\\\b(H|h)ospitalization|\\\\b(E|e)mergenc)\"\n    )\n  ) %>% \n  unnest(outcome, keep_empty = TRUE) %>% \n  group_by(doi) %>%\n   mutate(\n    outcome = tolower(outcome),\n    outcome = ifelse(str_starts(outcome, \"emergenc|hospitalization\"), \"Emergency\",\n                     ifelse(str_starts(outcome, \"death|mortalit\"), \"Mortality\", NA))\n  ) %>%\n  distinct(outcome, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  nest(outcome = outcome) %>%\n  select(-abstract_title)\n\n\n\nWe identify outcomes considered in the study for 81.4067612% of the articles.\nSub-population considered\nUsing a similar methodology, we try to identify the sub-population considered (infants or elderly). Note that, when the whole population is studied, we do not recover any information. It might be a bit far fetch to consider that when no sub-population is mentioned, the whole population is studied. We therefore abstain from doing so.\n\n\narticles_subpop <- abstracts_with_titles %>% \n  mutate(\n    subpop = str_extract_all(\n      abstract_title, \n      \"(\\\\b(I|i)nfant|\\\\b(E|e)lder)\"\n    )\n  ) %>% \n  unnest(subpop, keep_empty = TRUE) %>% \n  group_by(doi) %>%\n   mutate(\n    subpop = tolower(subpop),\n    subpop = ifelse(str_starts(subpop, \"infant\"), \"Infants\",\n                     ifelse(str_starts(subpop, \"elder\"), \"Elders\", NA))\n  ) %>%\n  distinct(subpop, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  nest(subpop = subpop) %>%\n  select(-abstract_title)\n\n\n\nWe identify sub-population considered in the study for 12.9770992% of the articles.\nAdditional information on journals\nIt is also interesting to have access to journal fields. This will enable us to see whether some academic research fields are more subject to certain type of issues than others.\nWe retrieve information on journal fields from Scopus. In their source list, they classify all journals into approximately 330 sub-subject areas. We thus match this with journal names from our database. Scopus also provides coarser subject area categorizations, for instance one with 5 fields: Multidisciplinary, Physical Sciences, Health Sciences, Social Sciences and Life Science. They provide a correspondance table between those two classifications.\nNote that, some journals mention several of these fields as references. We choose to classify those as multidisciplinary journals.\n\n\nsubject_subsubject_corres <-\n  read_csv(\"R/Inputs/scopus_subject_corres.csv\") %>%\n  rename(\n    area_code = Code,\n    subsubject_area = Field, \n    subject_area = `Subject area`\n  ) %>%\n  drop_na()\n\njournal_subsubject_corres <- read_csv(\"R/Inputs/scopus_journal_subsubject.csv\") %>% \n  rename(\n    journal = Title,\n    subsubject_area = `Scopus Sub-Subject Area`,\n    area_code = `Scopus ASJC Code (Sub-subject Area)`\n  ) %>% \n  select(journal, subsubject_area, area_code)\n\n#To classify journals as multidisciplinary\njournal_subject_corres <- journal_subsubject_corres %>% \n  left_join(subject_subsubject_corres, by = c(\"area_code\", \"subsubject_area\")) %>% \n  select(journal, subject_area) %>% \n  distinct() %>% \n  group_by(journal) %>% \n  mutate(\n    n_subject_area = n(),\n    subject_area = ifelse(n_subject_area > 1, \"Multidisciplinary\", subject_area)\n  ) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  select(-n_subject_area) %>% \n  distinct()\n\njournal_subject <- journal_subsubject_corres %>% \n  left_join(journal_subject_corres, by = c(\"journal\")) %>% \n  mutate(\n    journal_merge = str_to_lower(journal),\n    journal_merge = str_remove_all(journal_merge, \"[^\\\\w\\\\s]\")\n  )\n\narticles_journal_subject <- abstracts %>% \n  mutate(\n    journal_merge = str_to_lower(journal),\n    journal_merge = str_remove_all(journal_merge, \"[^\\\\w\\\\s]\")\n  ) %>% \n  left_join(journal_subject, by = \"journal_merge\") %>% \n  select(doi, subject_area, subsubject_area) %>% \n  distinct() %>% \n  nest(subsubject_area = c(subsubject_area)) \n\n\n\nWe retrieve information about the subject area for 87.7317339% articles and about the subsubject area for 94.1668846% of articles.\nAgregating the information\nFinally, we build the overall metadata set, by combining all the previous information.\n\n\nabstracts_and_metadata <- abstracts %>% \n  full_join(articles_n_obs, by = \"doi\") %>% \n  full_join(articles_pollutant, by = \"doi\") %>% \n  full_join(articles_outcome, by = \"doi\") %>% \n  full_join(articles_subpop, by = \"doi\") %>% \n  full_join(articles_journal_subject, by = \"doi\") %>% \n  group_by(doi) %>% \n  filter(\n    pub_date == max(pub_date, na.rm = TRUE) | \n      is.na(pub_date)\n  ) %>% #some articles have been published twice\n  ungroup()\n\n# saveRDS(abstracts_and_metadata, \"R/Outputs/abstracts_and_metadata.RDS\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case any problem remains, we use tryCatch to record the DOIs corresponding to errors in order to be able to handle them later.↩︎\nWe analyze the characteristics of articles doing so in another document.↩︎\n",

Through an extensive literature review, we retrieve the estimates and standard errors of nearly all studies published on this topic, which rely both on standard outcomes regressions and causal inference methods. We find that a non-negligible share of studies may suffer from low power issues and could thereby exaggerate effect sizes. The analysis of published results highlights potential shortcomings of the literature but does not enable to precisely identify drivers of theses issues. We therefore run realistic simulations to investigate how statistical power varies with the treatment effect size, the number of observations, the proportion of treated units as well as the distribution of the outcome. Instrumental variable estimates, when statistically significant, are more likely to overestimate true effect sizes than naive estimates. Researchers should also pay attention to the number of treated units and the average count of health outcomes as they are important drivers of statistical power and may lead to greatly overestimated true effect sizes.\n\n\n\n",

This data is a subset of the US National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS). The data set contains records of deaths, mean concentration data for carbon monoxide (CO), temperature data and calendar control variables (such as school holidays for instance). All variables are at the daily and city level. There is therefore a unique observation per date and per city in the data set.\nBackground on selected quasi-experiments\nWe focus on quasi experiments for which treatment is binary and homogeneous, both in time and across individuals. Treatment is also not correlated with covariates (apart for air pollution alerts in which case treatment is of course correlated with the pollutant level).\nTreatment on “random” days\nHere, we consider interventions leading to changes in air pollution levels on some random days. Examples of such interventions include transportation strikes. Of course, dates are often not defined as random and are likely to be correlated with unobserved variables. In the present setting, we first consider the golden standard case in which these days are actually defined at random. One can think of this case as a Randomized Control Trial: it represents what would happen if an experimenter could implement a treatment increasing pollution on random days.\nAir pollution alert\nHere, we consider interventions that affect exposure to air pollution when air pollution levels reach a given threshold. Examples of such interventions include air pollution alerts: when pollution reaches a certain level, alerts are released, inviting people to reduce their exposure.\nNo quasi experiment\nWe finally consider a case for which there is no quasi experiment. One can consider that in this case all units are treated. To measure the effect of air pollution on health in this case, we will use methods from the epidemiology literature, as discussed in the next section.\nIdentification method\nIn order to estimate the parameters of interest, we use several identification methods. We associate each identification method with a given quasi-experiment.\nReduced form\nWe use a reduced form model to estimate the effect of a treatment on random days. The overall idea of the reduced form approach is to only compare the average number of deaths or hospital admissions in cities with treatment to cities with no treatment on the same day, controlling for differences across cities. In such approach, we do not model the impact of the treatement on air pollution.\nThis identification method enables to estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), ie a difference in mean between the treated and the control group (\\(\\mathbb{E}[Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}]\\)). To do so, we use the following type of model:\n\\[Y_{ct} = \\alpha + \\beta T_{ct} + \\epsilon_{ct}\\] where, as in the whole document, \\(Y_{ct}\\) is the health outcome of interest (for instance mortality), in a city \\(c\\), at date \\(t\\). The parameter of interest is \\(\\beta\\) (we use this notation for all models) and \\(T_{ct}\\) is a dummy equal to 1 if the city \\(c\\) is treated at time \\(t\\) and 0 otherwise.\nThe identification assumption here is that the the potential outcomes are independent of the treatment (independence assumption). In our simulations, this is verified as the treatment is allocated randomly.\nRegression Discontinuity Design\nWe use a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD or RD) to estimate the effect of an air pollution alert type of intervention. The overall idea of the RD is to compare days just below the threshold to days just above the threshold (where exposure and health impacts are thus lower). The key identification assumption is that days just below and just above the threshold are comparable. Thus, no confounders should vary discontinuously at the threshold (local independence, \\((Y_{0i}, Y_{1i}) \\perp T_i|Z_i\\), for \\(Z_i \\in [c-a, c+a]\\) ) and the treatment should vary at threshold (relevance, \\(T_i = \\mathbb{1} \\{Z_i \\geq c\\}\\)). The way we model this, both these assumptions are verified. However, for large bandwidth, observations above and below the threshold may be less comparable.\nThis identification method enables to estimate a Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) at the cutoff, ie \\(\\mathbb{E}[Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}|Z_i = c]\\). To do so, we use the following type of model, but restricting our sample to observation just below and just above the threshold:\n\\[Y_{ct} = \\alpha + \\beta T_{ct} + \\epsilon_{ct}\\]\nInstrumental variable\nIn the previous identification methods, we tried to estimate a reduced form, ie looking at the effect of a treatment directly on mortality. We did not consider the effect of the treatment on air pollution, ie the mechanism. In this section, we instrument the effect of pollution on the outcome with an instrument/treatment. We basically model the effect of an exogeneous instrument on air pollution and use this information to retrieve a causal estimate of the short term effect of air pollution on health. Note that the class of treatments/instruments considered here can be broader than in the previous section. Yet, in these simulations, we only consider a treatment on random days, for simplicity.\nIn a first step, we only consider binary instruments such as thermal inversions and high/low wind speed for instance. This type of instruments corresponds to a large share of the instruments considered in the literature. The key assumption is that these treatments only affect the health outcome variable via their effect on air pollution. Since the treatment is drawn randomly this is verified in our simulations.\nLet’s denote \\(Z\\) this instrument. We compute a 2-Stages Least Squares (2SLS) where the first stage has the form:\n\\[Poll_{ct} = \\gamma + \\delta Z_{ct} + e_{ct}\\] and the second stage:\n\\[Y_{ct} = \\alpha + \\beta Poll_{ct} + \\epsilon_{ct}\\]\nLinear model\nFinally, we also consider simple linear models in order to measure the correlation between the health outcome of interest and air pollution, test controlling for potential confounders. The identification assumptions here are the usual OLS assumptions.\nWe estimate a model of the form:\n\\[Y_{ct} = \\alpha + \\beta Poll_{ct} + \\epsilon_{ct}\\]\nAnalysis\nOverall setting\nTo sum up the analysis, the aim is to measure the inference properties of different research designs aiming at measuring the short-term effects of air pollution on health. For simplicity, consider the daily number of death as the output variable of interest for now. We proceed as follows:\n\nWe draw a study period randomly.\nWe define the treated days, ie we define a treatment variable \\(T_{ct}\\) equal to 1 if the city \\(c\\) is treated at time \\(t\\) and zero otherwise.\nWe create a fake number of deaths, modifying the observed number of deaths and adding the treatment effect.\nWe estimate our model with \\(Y_{obs}\\) as a dependent variable and retrieve \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\).\nWe run the steps 1 through 5 \\(n_{iter}\\) times.\nWe compute the type M, type S, power and other statistics of interest.\nVarying “parameters”\nWe can vary several parameters to evaluate the sensitivity of power, type M and type S to the value of these parameters: the identification method, the number of observations, the proportion of treated days, the true effect size and the model specification. In order to limit the number of simulations and for clarity, in our analysis, we only modify one parameter at the time, keeping others constant and equal to a baseline value.\n\n\n\n",

We consider different types of quasi experiments and for each associate one or several identification strategies.\nThis document focuses on running the simulations. The results are analyzed and discussed in another document.\nFunction definitions\nSelecting the study period\nFirst, we create a function to randomly select a study period of a given length. This function also randomly selects a given number of cities to consider. For simplicity, we choose to have the same temporal study period for each city. This also seems realistic; a study focusing on several cities would probably consider a unique study period.\nThis function randomly selects a starting date for the study, early enough so that the study can actually last the number of days chosen. It then randomly draws a given number of cities and filters out observations outside of the study period. It returns a data set with only the desired number of cities and days.\n\n\nselect_study_period <- function(data, n_days = 3000, n_cities = 68) {\n  dates <- data[[\"date\"]]\n  err_proof_n_days <- min(n_days, length(unique(dates)))\n  cities <- data[[\"city\"]]\n  err_proof_n_cities <- min(n_cities, length(unique(cities)))\n  \n  begin_study <- sample(\n    seq.Date(\n      min(dates), \n      max(dates) - err_proof_n_days, \n      \"day\"\n    ), 1)\n  \n  dates_kept <- dplyr::between(\n    dates, \n    begin_study, \n    begin_study + err_proof_n_days\n  )\n  \n  cities_kept <- cities %in% sample(levels(cities), size = err_proof_n_cities)\n  \n  data_study <- data[(dates_kept & cities_kept),]\n  return(data_study)\n}\n\n\n\nDefining the treatment\nThen, we create a function to draw the treatment. This function adds a boolean vector to our data, stating whether each observation is in the treatment group or not. The drawing procedure depends on the quasi experiment considered (quasi_exp) and the proportion of treated observations (p_obs_treat). We consider three quasi-experiments:\nRandom days, corresponding to a random allocation of the treatment (random_days)\nAir pollution alerts (alert_... with … being the pollutant name )\nNo quasi-experiment (none)\nNote that for the alert, we will use RDD to estimate the effect of the treatment. We therefore restrict our sample to observations in a given bandwidth. We draw a threshold position from a uniform distribution from 0.2 to 0.4 in order to have enough observations in our data set. If we pick the threshold position too high up in the distribution of CO concentration, we may end up with observations very far away from the samples. For each city, we find the corresponding threshold and define a bandwidth such that p_obs_treat observations of the total sample are treated. Observations outside the bandwidth get a NA for treated. Thus, after calling this function, we need to filter out observations with a NA for treated.\n\n\ndraw_treated <- function(data, p_obs_treat = 0.5, quasi_exp = \"random_days\") {\n  \n  if (quasi_exp == \"random_days\") {\n    data[[\"treated\"]] <- rbernoulli(length(data[[\"date\"]]), p_obs_treat)\n  } else if (str_starts(quasi_exp, \"alert\")) {\n    pollutant <- str_extract(quasi_exp, \"(?<=_).+\")\n    # threshold_pos <- rbeta(1, 20, 7) \n    threshold_pos <- runif(1, 0.2, 0.4) \n    data <- data %>%\n      group_by(.data$city) %>%\n      mutate(\n        threshold = quantile(.data[[pollutant]], threshold_pos, names = FALSE),\n        bw_high = quantile(.data[[pollutant]], min(threshold_pos + p_obs_treat, 1), names = FALSE),\n        treated = ifelse(\n          .data[[pollutant]] > bw_high | .data[[pollutant]] < threshold - (bw_high - threshold), \n          NA, \n          (.data[[pollutant]] >= threshold)\n        )\n      ) %>%\n      select(-bw_high, -threshold) %>% \n      ungroup()\n  } else {\n    data[[\"treated\"]] <- TRUE\n  }\n  \n  return(data)\n}\n\n\n\nBoth to verify that everything works well and for illustration, we can make quick plots:\n\n\n\nCreating fake output\nWe then create the fake output, y_fake. The generative process depends on the identification method:\nFor binary treatments, we draw a treatment effect from a Poisson distribution with mean corresponding to the effect size desired.\nFor the OLS, we build a generative model that creates fake data based on the formula given and with an effect corresponding to the effect size desired.\nFor the IV, we use the same method as for the OLS but previously, we modified the value of pollutant concentration through the instrument. The instrument is binary and affects pollutant concentration: \\(Poll_{ct}^{fake} = Poll_{ct} + \\delta T_{ct} + e_{ct}\\), where \\(T_{ct}\\) is the treatment dummy, \\(\\delta\\) the treatment “intensity” (the iv_strength in our function) and \\(e \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 0.1)\\) a noise.\nWe also create a short function to detect a pollutant among independent variables of a formula. We also use this function later. In the present document we only consider CO but we made the function more general.\n\n\nfind_pollutant <- function(formula) {\n    pollutants_list <- c(\"co\", \"pm10\", \"pm2.5\", \"no\")\n    pollutant <- pollutants_list[pollutants_list %in% all.vars(formula)]\n    return(pollutant)\n}\n\ncreate_fake_output <- function(data,\n                      percent_effect_size = 0.5,\n                      id_method = \"reduced_form\", \n                      iv_strength = NA, \n                      formula) {\n  \n  fml <- Formula::as.Formula(formula)\n  dep_var <- all.vars(fml)[[1]]\n  \n  if (id_method == \"RDD\") {\n    \n    data <- data %>%\n      group_by(.data$city) %>%\n      mutate(\n        y1 = .data[[dep_var]] -\n          rpois(\n            n(),\n            mean(.data[[dep_var]], na.rm = TRUE) * percent_effect_size / 100\n          ) %>% suppressWarnings(), #warnings when is.na(dep_var) eg rpois(1, NA)\n        y_fake = .data[[\"y1\"]] * .data[[\"treated\"]] + .data[[dep_var]] * (1 - .data[[\"treated\"]])\n      ) %>%\n      ungroup()\n    \n  } else if (id_method == \"reduced_form\") {\n\n    #Just a different sign\n    data <- data %>%\n      group_by(.data$city) %>%\n      mutate(\n        y1 = .data[[dep_var]] +\n          rpois(\n            n(),\n            mean(.data[[dep_var]], na.rm = TRUE) * percent_effect_size / 100\n          ) %>% suppressWarnings(), #warnings when is.na(dep_var) eg rpois(1, NA)\n        y_fake = .data[[\"y1\"]] * .data[[\"treated\"]] + .data[[dep_var]] * (1 - .data[[\"treated\"]])\n      ) %>%\n      ungroup()\n    \n  } else if (id_method %in% c(\"OLS\", \"IV\")) {\n    pollutant <- find_pollutant(fml)\n    \n    if (id_method == \"IV\") {\n      data[[pollutant]] <- \n        data[[pollutant]] + \n        iv_strength*data[[\"treated\"]] +\n        rnorm(data[[pollutant]], 0, 0.1)\n      \n      #need to withdraw the first stage from the formula and add the pollutant\n      parts_formula <- str_split(formula, \"\\\\|\")[[1]]\n      formula_clean <- str_c(\n        parts_formula[1], \n        \"+\", str_extract(parts_formula[3], \"\\\\b.+(?=~)\"),\n        \"|\", parts_formula[2]\n      )\n    } else {\n      formula_clean <- formula\n    }\n    \n    fml <- Formula::as.Formula(formula_clean)\n    reg <- feols(data = data, fml = fml, combine.quick=FALSE)\n    reg$coefficients[[pollutant]] <- mean(data[[dep_var]])*percent_effect_size/100  \n    #to get beta as the increase in percent\n    res <- reg$residuals\n    \n    data[[\"y_fake\"]] <- predict(reg, data) + rnorm(res, mean(res), sd = sd(res))\n    # data[[\"y1\"]] <- ifelse(data[[\"y1\"]] < 0, 0, data[[\"y1\"]])\n  } \n  \n  return(data)\n} \n\n\n\nThe proportion of treated observations corresponds to the ratio of the number of orange dots and the total number of dots.\nEstimating the model\nWe can then estimate our model and retrieve the point estimate, p-value, standard error, number of observations and f-stat. The model should be specified in a three part formula as follows: y ~ x | fixed effects | endo_var ~ instrument. If one does not want to set fixed effects, a 0 should be put in the second part of the formula: y ~ x | 0 | endo_var ~ instrument.\n\n\nestimate_model <- function(data, formula) {\n  fml <- Formula::as.Formula(formula)\n  pasted_formula <- paste(str_c(fml)[[2]], str_c(fml)[[1]], str_c(fml)[[3]])\n  \n  #the param of interest varies across identification methods\n  param_of_interest <- \n    ifelse(str_count(pasted_formula, \"\\\\|\") == 2, #if IV (ie 3 parts rhs in formula)\n           str_c(\"fit\", find_pollutant(fml), sep = \"_\"), \n           ifelse(\"treated\" %in% all.vars(fml), \"treatedTRUE\", find_pollutant(fml)))\n  \n  #run the estimation\n  est_results <- feols(data = data, fml = fml, se = \"hetero\") \n  \n  #retrieve the useful info\n  nobs <- length(est_results$residuals)\n  fstat <- fitstat(est_results, type = \"ivf\")$ivf1 %>% as_vector() %>% .[[1]]\n  \n  est_results %>%\n    broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %>%\n    filter(term == param_of_interest) %>%\n    rename(p_value = p.value, se = std.error) %>%\n    select(estimate, p_value, se) %>%\n    mutate(\n      n_obs = nobs,\n      f_stat = fstat\n    )\n}   \n# estimate_model(draw_treated(nmmaps_data), \"death_total ~  temperature + temperature_squared | city + month^year + weekday | co ~ treated\")\n\n\n\nComputing simulations\nBefore running all these functions together to compute one simulation, we need to compute the true effect. The different identification methods aims to identify different estimands (ATE or ATET). We therefore write a short function to compute this true effect.\n\n\ncompute_true_effect <- function(data, id_method, percent_effect_size, dep_var) {\n  \n  if (id_method %in% c(\"OLS\", \"IV\")) {\n    true_effect <- percent_effect_size/100*mean(data[[dep_var]])\n  } else {#ATE\n    true_effect <- mean(data$y1 - data$y0, na.rm = TRUE)\n  }\n  \n  return(true_effect)\n}\n\n\n\nWe can now create a function running all the previous functions together and therefore performing an iteration of the simulation, for a given set of parameters. This function returns a one row data set with estimate, p-value, number of observations and true effect size.\n\n\ncompute_simulation <- function(data,\n                               n_days = 3000,\n                               n_cities = 68, \n                               p_obs_treat = 0.5,\n                               percent_effect_size = 1,\n                               quasi_exp = \"random_days\",\n                               id_method = \"reduced_form\", \n                               iv_strength = NA,\n                               formula = \"resp_total ~ treated\",\n                               progressbar = progressor()#to have a progressbar when mapping\n                               ) {\n  \n  fml <- Formula::as.Formula(formula)\n  dep_var <- all.vars(fml)[1]\n\n  sim_data <- data %>%\n    select_study_period(n_days, n_cities) %>%\n    mutate(y0 = .data[[dep_var]]) %>%\n    draw_treated(p_obs_treat, quasi_exp) %>% \n    create_fake_output(percent_effect_size, id_method, iv_strength, formula) %>% \n    filter(!is.na(treated)) #not necessary bc dropped in lm()\n  \n  updated_fml <- str_replace(formula, dep_var, \"y_fake\")\n\n  sim_output <- sim_data %>%\n    estimate_model(formula = updated_fml) %>% \n    mutate(\n      true_effect = compute_true_effect(\n        sim_data, \n        id_method, \n        percent_effect_size, \n        dep_var\n      ),\n      n_days = n_days, \n      n_cities = n_cities,\n      p_obs_treat = p_obs_treat,\n      percent_effect_size = percent_effect_size,\n      quasi_exp = quasi_exp,\n      id_method = id_method, \n      iv_strength = iv_strength,\n      formula = formula\n    )\n  \n  progressbar() \n  return(sim_output)\n}\n\nnmmaps_data %>%\n  compute_simulation(\n    data = .,\n    formula = \"death_total ~ treated + co + temperature + temperature_squared | city + month^year + weekday\",\n    quasi_exp = \"alert_co\",\n    id_method = \"RDD\",\n    iv_strength = 0.5,\n    n_days = 1000,\n    n_cities = 10,\n    percent_effect_size = 1,\n    p_obs_treat = 0.5\n  )\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 x 14\n  estimate   p_value    se n_obs f_stat true_effect n_days n_cities\n     <dbl>     <dbl> <dbl> <int> <lgl>        <dbl>  <dbl>    <dbl>\n1   -0.857 0.0000825 0.218  8081 NA          -0.301   1000       10\n# … with 6 more variables: p_obs_treat <dbl>,\n#   percent_effect_size <dbl>, quasi_exp <chr>, id_method <chr>,\n#   iv_strength <dbl>, formula <chr>\n\nWe will then loop this function to get a large number of replications of each simulation for a given set of parameters. We will also vary the values of the different parameter.\nRunning the simulations\nBefore running the simulations, we need to define the set of parameters to consider.\nDefining baseline parameters\nWe will create a table displaying in each row a set of parameters we want to have a simulation for, sim_param_evol. We will then map our function compute_simulation on this table.\nTo build sim_param_evol, we first define a set of baseline values for our parameters and store them in a data frame, sim_param_base.\n\n\nsim_param_base <- tibble(\n  n_days = 2500,\n  n_cities = 40,\n  p_obs_treat = 0.5,\n  percent_effect_size = 1, \n  iv_strength = 0.5,\n  formula = \"death_total ~ treated + temperature + temperature_squared | city + month^year + weekday\"\n)\n\n# saveRDS(sim_param_base, \"R/Outputs/sim_param_base.RDS\")\n# write_csv(sim_param_base, \"R/Outputs/sim_param_base.csv\")\n\n\n\nEvolution with values of a given parameter\nDefining parameters\nIn a first set of simulation, we vary the values of the parameters one after the other. We thus create vectors containing the different values of the parameters we want to test.\n\n\nvect_n_days <- c(100, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000)\nvect_p_obs_treat <- c(0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5)\nvect_percent_effect_size <- c(0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10)\nvect_iv_strength <- c(0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.7)\nvect_formula <- c(\n  # \"death_total ~ treated\",\n  \"resp_total ~ treated + temperature + temperature_squared | city + month^year + weekday\",\n  \"death_total ~ treated + temperature + temperature_squared | city + month^year + weekday\",\n  \"copd_age_65_75 ~ treated + temperature + temperature_squared | city + month^year + weekday\"\n)\n\n\n\nWe then want to create the actual table, varying the parameters one after the other. To do so, we create a simple function add_values_param. This function adds the values of a parameter contained in a vector. We can then loop this function on all the vectors of parameters of interest.\n\n\n#adds all values in vect_param\nadd_values_param <- function(df, vect_param) {\n  param_name <- str_remove(vect_param, \"vect_\")\n  \n  tib_param <- tibble(get(vect_param))\n  names(tib_param) <- param_name\n  \n  df %>% \n    full_join(tib_param, by = param_name) %>% \n    fill(everything(), .direction = \"downup\")\n}\n\nvect_of_vect_param <- c(\n  \"vect_n_days\", \n  \"vect_p_obs_treat\", \n  \"vect_percent_effect_size\", \n  \"vect_iv_strength\", \n  \"vect_formula\"\n)\n\nsim_param_unique <- \n  map_dfr(\n    vect_of_vect_param, \n    add_values_param, \n    df = sim_param_base\n  ) %>% \n  distinct() #bc base parameters appear twice\n\n\n\nWe want to compute our simulations for this set of parameters for every identification method so we replicate this set of parameters for each identification method (and add information about the associated quasi-experiment). Then, in order to identify the effect of interest, we need to consider different types of equations, depending on the identification method considered. For each set of parameters we want to run many iterations of the simulation so we replicate the dataset n_iter times. It will enable us to loop compute_simulation directly on sim_param_evol.\nNote that we make a bunch of small modification to have more realistic parameters. For instance, we only consider small proportions of treated observations for the RDD.\nWe wrap all this into a function, prepare_sim_param.\n\n\nprepare_sim_param <- function(df_sim_param, \n                              vect_id_methods = c(\"reduced_form\", \"RDD\", \"OLS\", \"IV\"), \n                              n_iter = 10) {\n  \n  sim_param_clean <- df_sim_param %>%\n    crossing(vect_id_methods) %>%\n    rename(id_method = vect_id_methods) %>%\n    mutate(\n      quasi_exp = case_when(\n        id_method == \"reduced_form\" ~ \"random_days\",\n        str_starts(id_method, \"RDD\") ~ \"alert_co\",\n        id_method == \"OLS\" ~ \"none\",\n        id_method == \"IV\" ~ \"random_days\",\n      )\n    ) %>% \n    mutate(\n      formula = case_when(\n        id_method == \"OLS\" ~ str_replace_all(formula, \"treated\", \"co\"),\n        id_method == \"IV\" ~ paste(\n          str_remove_all(formula, \"(\\\\+\\\\s)?\\\\btreated\\\\b(\\\\s\\\\+)?\"),\n          \"| co ~ treated\"\n          ),\n        TRUE ~ formula\n      )\n    ) %>% \n    filter(!str_detect(formula, \"~\\\\s{0,2}\\\\|\")) %>% \n    #adapting parameters\n    mutate(\n      p_obs_treat = ifelse(id_method == \"RDD\", p_obs_treat/5, p_obs_treat),\n      p_obs_treat = ifelse(id_method == \"OLS\", NA, p_obs_treat),\n      iv_strength = ifelse(id_method != \"IV\", NA, iv_strength)\n    ) %>% \n    distinct() %>% #to erase the duplicates due to iv_strength in non-iv id_methods\n    arrange(id_method, n_days) %>% \n    crossing(rep_id = 1:n_iter) %>%\n    select(-rep_id) \n  \n  return(sim_param_clean)\n} \n\nsim_param_evol <- prepare_sim_param(sim_param_unique, n_iter = 1)\n\n# write_csv(sim_param, \"../Outputs/sim_param.csv\")\n\n\n\nRunning the simulation\nWe can then run the simulations for each set of parameter, using a pmap_dfr function. We wrote a function to do that while saving intermediary outcomes (every save_every iteration). name_save is the name to use to save an intermediary outcome (to which we add _intermediary and the iteration number).\n\n\nrun_all_sim <- function(data, sim_param, save_every, name_save) {\n  output <- NULL\n  future::plan(multicore)\n  \n  tic()\n  for (i in 1:ceiling(nrow(sim_param)/save_every)) {\n    params_slice <- sim_param %>% \n      slice((1 + save_every*(i-1)):(save_every*i))\n    \n    with_progress({\n      p <- progressor(steps = nrow(params_slice), on_exit = FALSE)\n      \n      intermediary_output <- future_pmap_dfr(\n        params_slice,\n        compute_simulation,\n        data = data,\n        progressbar = p,\n        .options = furrr_options(seed = TRUE)\n      )\n    })\n    \n    print(paste(\"Iteration =\", i*save_every))\n    output <- output %>% rbind(intermediary_output)\n    saveRDS(\n      intermediary_output, \n      here(\"R\", \"Outputs\", \"Sim_save\", str_c(name_save, \"_intermediary_\", i*save_every,\".RDS\"))\n    )\n  }\n  toc()\n  return(output)\n}\n\nsim_evol_large <- run_all_sim(nmmaps_data, sim_param_evol, save_every = 10000, \"sim_evol\")\n\n# beepr::beep(1)\n\n# saveRDS(sim_evol_large, here(\"R\", \"Outputs\", \"sim_evol_large.RDS\"))\n\n\n\nSummarising the results\nWe then build the function summarise_simulations to summarize our results, computing power, type M and so on for each set of parameters. Note that this function can only take as input a data frame produced by compute_simulation (or a mapped version of this function).\n\n\nsummarise_simulations <- function(data) {\n  \n  data %>% \n    mutate(\n      CI_low = estimate + se*qnorm((1-0.95)/2),\n      CI_high = estimate - se*qnorm((1-0.95)/2),\n      length_CI = abs(CI_high - CI_low),\n      covered = (true_effect > CI_low & true_effect < CI_high), \n      covered_signif = ifelse(p_value > 0.05, NA, covered) #to consider only significant estimates\n    ) %>% \n    group_by(formula, quasi_exp, n_days, n_cities, p_obs_treat, percent_effect_size, id_method, iv_strength) %>%\n    summarise(\n      power = mean(p_value <= 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)*100, \n      type_m = mean(ifelse(p_value <= 0.05, abs(estimate/true_effect), NA), na.rm = TRUE),\n      type_s = sum(ifelse(p_value <= 0.05, sign(estimate) != sign(true_effect), NA), na.rm = TRUE)/n()*100,\n      coverage_rate = mean(covered_signif, na.rm = TRUE)*100,\n      coverage_rate_all = mean(covered, na.rm = TRUE)*100,\n      # mse = mean((estimate - true_effect)^2, na.rm = TRUE),\n      # normalized_bias = mean(abs((estimate - true_effect/true_effect)), na.rm = TRUE),\n      # estimate_true_ratio = mean(abs(estimate/true_effect), na.rm = TRUE),\n      mean_f_stat = mean(f_stat, na.rm = TRUE),\n      mean_signal_to_noise = mean(estimate/length_CI, na.rm = TRUE),\n      .groups  = \"drop\"\n    ) %>% \n    ungroup() %>% \n    mutate(\n      outcome = str_extract(formula, \"^[^\\\\s~]+(?=\\\\s?~)\"),\n      n_days = as.integer(n_days),\n      n_cities = as.integer(n_cities)\n    )\n} \n\n\n\nWe then run this function.\n\n\nsummary_evol_large <- summarise_simulations(sim_evol_large) %>% \n  mutate(outcome = fct_relevel(outcome, \"copd_age_65_75\", \"resp_total\", \"death_total\"))\n\n# saveRDS(summary_evol_large, here(\"R\", \"Outputs\", \"summary_evol_large.RDS\"))\n\n\n\nSmall number of observations\nWe then replicate this analysis for a smaller and more realistic baseline number of observations (10 cities and 1000 days).\n\n\nsim_param_base_small <- tibble(\n  n_days = 1000,\n  n_cities = 10,\n  p_obs_treat = 0.5,\n  percent_effect_size = 1, \n  iv_strength = 0.5,\n  formula = \"death_total ~ treated + temperature + temperature_squared | city + month^year + weekday\"\n)\n\nsim_param_unique_small <- \n  map_dfr(\n    vect_of_vect_param, \n    add_values_param, \n    df = sim_param_base\n  ) %>% \n  distinct() \n\nsim_param_evol_small <- prepare_sim_param(sim_param_unique_small, n_iter = 1) %>% \n  filter(!(id_method == \"RDD\" & p_obs_treat <= 0.01)) \n\nsim_evol_small <- run_all_sim(nmmaps_data, sim_param_evol_small, save_every = 10, \"sim_evol_small\")\n\n# saveRDS(sim_evol_small, here(\"R\", \"Outputs\", \"sim_evol_small.RDS\"))\n\nsummary_evol_small <- summarise_simulations(sim_evol_small) %>% \n  mutate(outcome = fct_relevel(outcome, \"copd_age_65_75\", \"resp_total\", \"death_total\"))\n\n# saveRDS(summary_evol_small, here(\"R\", \"Outputs\", \"summary_evol_small.RDS\"))\n\n\n\nDecomposing the number of observations into number of cities and days\nIn this section, we wonder whether only the total number of observations maters or whether the ratio between number of cities and length of the study matters. We want to see whether decreasing the number of cities studied while keeping the number of observations constant (thus increasing the number of days) affects power and type M error. We thus run several simulations with an identical number of observations but different numbers of cities/days. We repeat this for 3 different number of observations (1000, 2000 and 4000) to check the robustness of our findings.\nWe first define the set of parameters:\n\n\nsim_param_decomp_nobs <- \n  tibble(n_cities = c(1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 25, 34)) %>%\n  crossing(n_obs = c(1000, 2000, 3000)) %>%\n  mutate(n_days = round(n_obs/n_cities)) %>% \n  select(-n_obs) %>% \n  full_join(sim_param_base, by = c(\"n_cities\", \"n_days\")) %>% \n  fill(everything(), .direction = \"updown\") %>% \n  anti_join(#because sim_param_base not in the exact set of param we want here\n    sim_param_base,\n    by = c(\"n_cities\", \"n_days\", \"p_obs_treat\", \"percent_effect_size\", \"iv_strength\", \"formula\")\n  ) %>% \n  prepare_sim_param(n_iter = 1000) \n\n\n\nWe then run the simulations.\n\n\nsim_decomp_nobs <- run_all_sim(nmmaps_data, sim_param_decomp_nobs, 10000, \"sim_decomp_nobs\")\n\n# saveRDS(sim_decomp_nobs, here(\"R\", \"Outputs\", \"sim_decomp_nobs.RDS\"))\n\nsummary_decomp_nobs <- summarise_simulations(sim_decomp_nobs) %>% \n    mutate(decomp_var = \"n_obs\")\n# saveRDS(summary_decomp_nobs, here(\"R\", \"Outputs\", \"summary_decomp_nobs.RDS\"))\n\n\n\nDecomposing the number of treated into number of observations and proportion of treated\nWe now then want to test whether we can combine information about the proportion of treated and the number of observations (into the number of treated). To do so, we use a methodology analog to the previous one.\nWe first define the set of parameters:\n\n\nsim_param_decomp_ptreat <- \n  tibble(p_obs_treat = c(0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5)) %>%\n  crossing(n_treat = c(500, 1000, 2000)) %>%\n  mutate(\n    n_obs = round(n_treat/p_obs_treat),\n    n_cities = 50, #needs to be big enough\n    n_days = round(n_obs/n_cities)\n  ) %>% \n  select(-n_obs, -n_treat) %>% \n  full_join(sim_param_base, by = c(\"n_cities\", \"n_days\", \"p_obs_treat\")) %>% \n  fill(everything(), .direction = \"updown\") %>% \n  anti_join(#because sim_param_base not in the exact set of param we want here\n    sim_param_base,\n    by = c(\"n_cities\", \"n_days\", \"p_obs_treat\", \"percent_effect_size\", \"iv_strength\", \"formula\")\n  ) %>% \n  prepare_sim_param(n_iter = 1000) %>% \n  filter(id_method != \"OLS\")\n\n\n\nWe then run the simulations.\n\n\nsim_decomp_ptreat <-  run_all_sim(nmmaps_data, sim_param_decomp_ptreat, 10000, \"sim_decomp_ptreat\")\n\n# saveRDS(sim_decomp_ptreat, here(\"R\", \"Outputs\", \"sim_decomp_ptreat.RDS\"))\n\n\nsummary_decomp_ptreat <- summarise_simulations(sim_decomp_ptreat) %>% \n    mutate(decomp_var = \"n_treat\")\n# saveRDS(summary_decomp_ptreat, here(\"R\", \"Outputs\", \"summary_decomp_ptreat.RDS\"))\n\nsummary_decomp <- summary_decomp_nobs %>% \n    rbind(summary_decomp_ptreat)\n\n# saveRDS(summary_decomp, here(\"R\", \"Outputs\", \"summary_decomp.RDS\"))\n\n\n\nUsual values in the literature\nIn previous simulations, we varied all parameters, choosing somehow arbitrary values for the base parameters.
