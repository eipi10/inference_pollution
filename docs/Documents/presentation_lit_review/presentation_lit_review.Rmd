# Motivation

(Why are we carrying this study out?)

- Health effects of air pollution are often tiny

--

- They are difficult to detect

- When effects are tiny and/or power is low, there is a threat of type M and type S error (and therefore of bias)

# Objective of this study

(What do we want to get out from this study?)

- To what extent is the existing literature likely to be subject to such issues?

- Are some identification strategies more prone to this type of problems than others?

---

# Method(s)

## Overview

1. Thorough literature review of the causal literature  

1. Systematic review of the epidemiology literature

- Retrieve point estimates and s.e. of estimates and compute power, type M and type S errors under a set of scenarii

--

## Why do we carry out two different types of analyses?

- Vast epidemiology literature => we cannot look at each study separately

- The causal literature is less important => we look at it in details

- Downsides: only a limited number of papers in the causal literature and we cannot know exactly what each epidemiology paper is looking at

---

## Detailed methodology

### Causal

- We read the papers in details 

- Retrieve the main estimates and s.e., sample size and so on

- If 

### Systematic
