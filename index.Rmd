Hi and welcome!

This is the website for the paper [Accurately Estimating Relatively Small Effects: Air Pollution and Health](inference_pollution_paper.pdf). It gathers the paper, all the code and some additional material.

In this paper, I assess the ability of various research designs in measuring small effects, that of air pollution on health in the short-term. 

A previous version of this project was co-authored with LÃ©o Zabrocki-Hallak who extensively contributed to this project
