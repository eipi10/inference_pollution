# Abstract

We explore statistical power issues of various empirical strategies implemented to estimate the short-term health effect of air pollution. Through an extensive literature review, we retrieve the estimates and standard errors of nearly all studies published on this topic, which rely both on standard outcomes regressions and causal inference methods. We find that a non-negligible share of studies may suffer from low power issues and could thereby exaggerate effect sizes. The analysis of published results highlights potential shortcomings of the literature but does not enable to precisely identify drivers of theses issues. We therefore run realistic simulations to investigate how statistical power varies with the treatment effect size, the number of observations, the proportion of treated units as well as the distribution of the outcome. Instrumental variable estimates, when statistically significant, are more likely to overestimate true effect sizes than naive estimates. Researchers should also pay attention to the number of treated units and the average count of health outcomes as they are important drivers of statistical power and may lead to greatly overestimated true effect sizes.
