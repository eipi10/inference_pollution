Hi and welcome!

This is the website for the paper [Why Some Acute Health Effects of Air Pollution Could be Inflated](wp_bagilet_zabrocki.pdf). It gathers the paper, all the code and some additional material.

In this paper, I assess the ability of different statistical methods and research designs to accurately measure the short term health effects of air pollution. Based on the findings, I build a list of recommendations and pitfalls to avoid in future studies.
