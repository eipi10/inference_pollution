Hi and welcome!

This website gathers code and additional material for the paper [Why Some Acute Health Effects of Air Pollution Could be Inflated](wp_bagilet_zabrocki.pdf) by [Vincent Bagilet](https://vincentbagilet.github.io/) and [Léo Zabrocki-Hallak](https://lzabrocki.github.io/).

In this paper, we assess the ability of different statistical methods and research designs to accurately measure the short term health effects of air pollution. Based on our findings, we build a list of recommendations and pitfalls to avoid in future studies.
