- While LÃ©o was working on several projects on short term health effects of air pollution some questions arose:

  - How do different methods compare in terms of estimation of these effects?
  
  - How should we handle missing data in such studies?
  
- Starting from there, it led to additional questions

  - Are missing data an actual problem?
  
  - What is the usual power in such studies? Does it varies with estimation methods?

- Very methodological project: we are interested in learning a lot of methods

# Main questions and motivation

- What is the usual **power** in studies of short-term health effects of air pollution?
  
- How do **different identification strategies** perform to estimate these effects?
  
- What is the impact of **missing data** on these estimates? 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width= 350, fig.align="center"} 
knitr::include_graphics("images/pollution_paris.jpg")
```
  
- I skip the motivation section for the sake of time

???

- The questions we will focus on will also depend on our results: it might be the case that missing data is not a problem for instance. In this case we would not focus on this

- You know why understanding the health effects of air pollution is an important question
